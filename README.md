### Contents

A series of examples of using the various tools modern Java has to offer to enable asynchronous programming. It 
showcases features available all the way to Java 21, with an extra package that peeks at preview features available in
Java 22

**Note:** The code is for illustration purposes only, many shortcuts have been taken to make it as concise as possible to 
emphasize the showcased mechanisms or APIs, while eschewing all other considerations (e.g. correctness or error 
handling)

### Setting up

The project uses Gradle, Gradle wrapper and the Gradle toolchains plugin, so as long as you have some version of Java
installed, simply running
```./gradlew build```
it will download the required Gradle version and a suitable JDK for you.


Enjoy! (that's mandatory)
